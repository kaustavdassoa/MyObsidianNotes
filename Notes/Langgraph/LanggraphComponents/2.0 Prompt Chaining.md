## Summary

 "Prompt Chaining," a fundamental workflow pattern in LangGraph. Prompt chaining is "a technique in natural language processing where multiple prompts are sequenced together to guide a model through a complex task or reasoning process." Rather than relying on a single prompt, prompt chaining breaks complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps that are executed sequentially, with each step building on the previous one.​

The core benefit is that this approach improves accuracy, coherence, and control when working with large language models. 

#### Prompt Chaining

Prompt chaining is a technique in natural language processing where multiple prompts are sequenced together to guide a model through a complex task or reasoning process. Instead of relying on a single prompt to achieve a desired outcome, prompt chaining breaks the task into smaller, manageable steps, with each step building on the previous one. This approach can improve accuracy, coherence, and control when working with large language models.

LangGraph, is a framework designed to facilitate structured interactions with language models, making it an excellent tool for implementing prompt chaining. It allows you to define a graph of nodes (representing individual prompts or tasks) and edges (representing the flow of information between them). This structure enables dynamic, multi-step conversations or workflows, where the output of one node can feed into the input of the next.

#### How Prompt Chaining Works with LangGraph

1. Define the Task: Start by breaking down the problem into smaller sub-tasks. For example, if you want to generate a detailed report, you might split it into steps like "gather data," "analyze data," and "write summary."
2. Create Nodes: Each sub-task becomes a node in the LangGraph structure. A node could be a prompt that instructs the model to perform a specific action, such as "List key facts about X" or "Summarize the following text."
3. Establish Edges: Edges define the sequence and dependencies between nodes. For instance, the output of the "gather data" node flows into the "analyze data" node, ensuring the model has the necessary context to proceed.
4. Execute the Graph: LangGraph processes the nodes in order, passing information along the edges. The model generates responses step-by-step, refining the output as it progresses through the chain.
5. Iterate if Needed: LangGraph supports conditional logic and loops, so you can revisit earlier nodes or adjust the flow based on intermediate results.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Task Decomposition Strategy**: "Breaking the task into smaller, manageable steps" is the fundamental principle of prompt chaining—complex problems are divided into sequential, executable tasks rather than solved in one go.
    
2. **Sequential Execution with Conditions**: The workflow uses "conditions" between steps. If a condition passes, the workflow moves to the next task; if it fails, it can loop back to retry or take an alternative path.
    
3. **Workflow Architecture**: A typical prompt chaining workflow consists of:
    
    - Input processing
        
    - LLM calls with logic
        
    - Conditional gates between steps
        
    - Sequential task execution
        
4. **Real-World Use Case Example**: The "Generate a Story" workflow demonstrates the pattern:
    
    - **Step 1**: Generate initial story
        
    - **Condition**: Evaluate if story meets criteria (Pass/Fail)
        
    - **Step 2**: Improve the story (if passed)
        
    - **Step 3**: Polish the story
        
    - **Retry Logic**: If failed, loop back to generate a new story
        
5. **LangGraph Integration**: This pattern is natively supported in LangGraph documentation and can be implemented step-by-step through code, which will be covered in the next video (Prompt Chaining Implementation with Langgraph).
    
6. **Importance for Complex Tasks**: Workflows are essential "because let's say that if you really want to implement some of the use cases and for that particular use cases, when you're designing a workflow, you can follow some specific patterns."[](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-agentic-ai-bootcamp-with-langgraph-and-langchain/learn/lecture/48879965#overview)​
