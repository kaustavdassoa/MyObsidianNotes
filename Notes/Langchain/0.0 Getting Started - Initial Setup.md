This section covers the installation / configuration of the following framework 

- OpenAI
- LangChain 
- LangSmith
- LangServe
- Huggingface 

## **Setup**

##### **How to Get an OpenAI API Key ?**

Follow these steps to generate a new API key. Note that you must have a funded account for the key to work.

1. **Log in to the Platform:** Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) and log in (or sign up).
2. **Set Up Billing (Crucial):**
    - Navigate to **Settings** (gear icon) > **Billing**.
    - Add a payment method and purchase initial credits (minimum $5). _Note: Free trial credits are rare; most keys require a paid balance to function._
3. **Access API Keys:**
    - Click on **Dashboard** in the top navigation bar.
    - On the left sidebar, click **API Keys**.
        
4. **Create New Key:**
    - Click the **+ Create new secret key** button.
    - (Optional) Name your key (e.g., "My App Project") and set permissions (default is usually fine).
    - Click **Create secret key**.

5. **Copy & Save:**
    - **Copy the key immediately.** You will **never** see this full key again once you close the window.
    - Paste it into your code or `.env` file securely.
##### **How to Get LangChain Keys ?** 

The keys you need are for **LangSmith**, the platform used to trace and debug LangChain applications.

1. **Log in:** Go to [smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com/) and sign up or log in.
2. **Go to Settings:** Click the **Settings** icon (⚙️) in the bottom-left corner of the sidebar.
3. **Create Key:**
    - Click on the **API Keys** tab.
    - Click **Create API Key**.
    - Description (Optional): Name it (e.g., "Personal Project").
    - **Copy the key** immediately.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Three Critical LangChain Modules**: 
	- LangChain (the core framework)
	- LangSmith (for monitoring, debugging, and tracing applications from prototype to production)
	- LangServe (for deploying applications as production-ready APIs)
    
2. **LangSmith Setup Required**: Creating a LangSmith account is essential for monitoring and debugging AI applications. You can create free API keys within LangSmith's settings to enable comprehensive tracking of your application's requests and performance.
3. **OpenAI API Key Setup**: To use OpenAI models, you need to sign up on the OpenAI platform (platform.openai.com) and create an API key. A minimum of $5 in credits is required to access the API, though actual usage depends on your application's complexity.
4. **Environment Configuration with .env File**: Create a `.env` file to securely store sensitive credentials including: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`, and `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT` name.
5. **Python Dependencies**: Install required packages including `langchain` and `python-dotenv` (to load environment variables from the .env file). If using Jupyter notebooks, also install `ipykernel`.
6. **Open Source Alternative to OpenAI**: For those without OpenAI API access or wanting to experiment with open-source models, Ollama provides an alternative that the instructor will demonstrate in subsequent videos.
7. **Core LangChain Components to Master**: The foundational elements for building applications are prompt templates, models, and output parsers—which are covered in the next lectures.
8. **Production Readiness**: The course progression moves from basic component understanding to building sample applications, then tracing them with LangSmith, and finally deploying them as APIs using LangServe to make them production-ready.
9. **No Portal Sign-up Needed for LangChain/LangServe**: Unlike OpenAI, you only need to sign up for LangSmith if you want monitoring capabilities; LangChain and LangServe are open-source frameworks that work locally without registration.
10. **Course Structure Foundation**: This video establishes the complete setup so learners can follow all subsequent lectures without interruption, emphasizing the importance of completing these prerequisites before advancing further in the course.
