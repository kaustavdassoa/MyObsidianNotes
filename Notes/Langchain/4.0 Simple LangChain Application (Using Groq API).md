#### What is Groq ? 

Groq is an AI hardware company specializing in high-speed inference for large language models. It develops the Language Processing Unit (LPU), a custom ASIC designed to outperform GPUs in AI inference tasks.

Groq's LPU represents a departure from general-purpose GPUs, focusing exclusively on inference—the phase where trained AI models generate predictions or responses. The architecture emphasizes deterministic execution, high memory bandwidth, and energy efficiency, enabling sub-millisecond latencies for real-time applications. Unlike GPUs optimized for both training and inference, LPUs prioritize throughput for production workloads like chatbots and semantic search.

Key advantages include 10x faster processing for LLMs compared to traditional hardware, with significantly lower power consumption, making it ideal for scalable cloud deployments.

#### Products and Platforms

Groq offers two primary deployment options:
- **GroqCloud**: A serverless platform providing on-demand access to LPU-powered inference. Developers integrate via simple APIs, running models like Llama, Mixtral, and Gemma at speeds up to 500+ tokens/second.
- **GroqRack**: On-premises hardware clusters for enterprises requiring dedicated infrastructure, supporting massive scale in data centers.​

The company supports popular frameworks including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face, with over 2.5 million developers using the platform.

#### Pricing 

Groq offers a free tier for developers on GroqCloud that requires no credit card and provides access to their LPU-powered inference API up to specified rate limits.
