## Summary

This lecture covers the second embedding technique in the series, focusing on Ollama - an open-source platform for running large language models locally. The instructor explains how Ollama allows developers to use various open-source models (Llama 2, Llama 3, Mistral, Gamma) without relying on paid APIs like OpenAI. The video walks through the complete setup process: downloading Ollama from ollama.com for Windows, Mac, or Linux; installing it locally; downloading specific language models; and then using Llama embeddings through LangChain's community library.

The practical demonstration shows how to import embeddings from `langchain_community.embeddings`, initialize Ollama embeddings (which defaults to Llama 2), and then embed documents and queries. The instructor demonstrates embedding a sample list of documents about Greek alphabet letters and shows how similar queries produce similar vector representations. The video also explores multiple embedding models available through Ollama (such as mxbai-embed-large with 1024 dimensions) and discusses integration with vector databases like Chroma DB for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Ollama as an Alternative**: Ollama is an open-source platform that enables running large language models locally on your machine without relying on paid APIs.
    
2. **Supported Models**: Ollama supports multiple open-source models including Llama 2, Llama 3, Mistral, Phi 3, Gamma, and Code Llama, among others.
    
3. **Cross-Platform Support**: Ollama is available for Windows (requires Windows 10 or later), macOS, and Linux.
    
4. **Installation Process**: Download the executable from ollama.com, double-click the installer, click next repeatedly, and the Ollama icon will appear in the system taskbar.
    
5. **Model Download Commands**: Use `ollama run [model-name]` (e.g., `ollama run gamma2b`) to automatically download and run models from the command line.
    
6. **Default Model Behavior**: LangChain's `OllamaEmbeddings` defaults to Llama 2, but you must have that model downloaded locally first.
    
7. **Embedding Library**: Import embeddings using `from langchain_community.embeddings import OllamaEmbeddings` rather than langchain-openai.
    
8. **Vector Dimensions Vary by Model**: Different models produce different dimensional embeddings - Gamma 2B creates 2048-dimensional vectors, while mxbai-embed-large creates 1024-dimensional vectors.
    
9. **Two Embedding Methods**: LangChain provides `embed_documents()` for embedding text collections and `embed_query()` for embedding single queries.
    
10. **Semantic Similarity**: Similar texts produce similar vector values, enabling semantic search and retrieval tasks (e.g., a question about "the second letter of Greek alphabet" matches the answer "beta is the second character letter").
    
11. **Multiple Embedding Models**: Beyond the default Llama 2, explore other lightweight embedding models like mxbai-embed-large, nomic-embed-text, and all-mini-lm.
    
12. **Local-First Approach**: All models are downloaded locally, making it suitable for development and avoiding API costs, similar to how Docker images are downloaded.
    
13. **RAG Integration**: Ollama embeddings integrate with vector databases like Chroma DB to build retrieval-augmented generation applications.
    
14. **Cost Efficiency**: Unlike OpenAI's paid API, Ollama provides a free, open-source solution for embedding tasks when computational resources are available locally.
