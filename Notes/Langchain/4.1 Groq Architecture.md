Groq's Language Processing Unit (LPU) represents a fundamental departure from conventional GPU-based inference architectures. Rather than designing a general-purpose processor optimized for both training and inference, Groq built a specialized ASIC from first principles as a deterministic, single-core architecture with an assembly-line dataflow model. This design philosophy trades memory capacity for memory bandwidth and architectural predictability, achieving 2-18x higher token generation speeds than GPU alternatives for streaming inference workloads while introducing significant scaling complexity. Understanding Groq's architecture is essential for evaluating inference acceleration options in production AI systems.

## Architectural Philosophy: The Inversion of Complexity

Groq's design inverts the traditional relationship between hardware and software. While GPUs place complexity in hardware—multiple cores, dynamic schedulers, caches that require runtime management—Groq minimizes hardware complexity and distributes orchestration responsibility to the compiler. This enables four core design principles that differentiate the platform:​

**Software-first design** places the compiler in control of every execution detail, from instruction timing to network packet routing. This represents an unusually deep hardware-software co-design where the compiler has complete visibility into execution timings.

**Programmable assembly line architecture** replaces the GPU's "hub-and-spoke" topology—where cores connect to a central control point—with a linear dataflow where data flows through functional units in a pipeline. Like physical assembly lines, each stage processes data and passes results to the next stage with no bottlenecks or waiting.[](https://groq.com/blog/the-groq-lpu-explained)​

**Deterministic compute and networking** eliminate non-determinism endemic to conventional systems. Every instruction completes in a known number of cycles; network packets follow pre-planned routes with zero collisions; timing is completely predictable.[](https://groq.com/blog/inside-the-lpu-deconstructing-groq-speed)​

**On-chip SRAM as primary storage** inverts the memory hierarchy. Rather than using SRAM as a cache for external DRAM or HBM, Groq stores model weights and intermediate activations directly in on-chip SRAM, eliminating latency and enabling extreme memory bandwidth.
